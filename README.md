Go with Restful Api 


## We installed a structure of a E-Commerce Portal
We have a 7 models, These are:
  1- Books
  2- Authors
  3- Customers
  4- Stores
  5-Companies
  6-Baskets
  7-Payments
## All of the models seperate each other and attached to Model Folder
## And all of the pages' relationships provide with go.mod(github.com/Ertugrulbal/models) file.

Also I researched RestFul API and HTTP Methods and I published story at Medium.com, Link is attached below:
