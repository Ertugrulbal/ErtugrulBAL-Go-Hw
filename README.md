- ErtugrulBAL-Go-Hw Version2
- Go with Restful Api 


- We installed a structure of a E-Commerce Portal
- We have a 7 models, These are:
  * Books
  - Authors
  - Customers
  - Stores
  - Companies
  - Baskets
  - Payments
- All of the models seperate each other and attached to Model Folder
- And all of the pages' relationships provide with go.mod(github.com/Ertugrulbal/models) file.
